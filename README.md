# 📊 Schizophrenia Data Analysis & Machine Learning Model

## 📌 Project Overview

This project involves analyzing a schizophrenia dataset and building a machine learning model to predict medication adherence. The pipeline includes:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

- Model Training & Evaluation

- Debugging Data Leakage Issues

- Cross-Validation for Robustness

- Hyperparameter Tuning for Model Optimization

## 📂 Dataset Information

The dataset consists of various patient attributes, including:

- Demographics: Age, Gender, Education Level, Marital Status, Occupation, Income Level, Living Area

- Medical Information: Diagnosis, Disease Duration, Hospitalizations, Family History, Substance Use, Suicide Attempt

- Clinical Scores: Positive & Negative Symptom Scores, GAF Score

- Social & Environmental Factors: Social Support, Stress Factors

- Medication Adherence (Target Variable)

## 🧐 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We performed:

- Distribution analysis 📊

- Feature correlations 🔍


## 🔥 Key Findings:

- Age vs. Disease Duration & Hospitalizations: Older patients tend to have longer disease durations and more hospitalizations.

- Medication adherence is influenced by stress levels & social support.


## ⚙️ Data Preprocessing

Steps taken before training the model:


- Encoded Categorical Variables (One-hot encoding & Label encoding)

- Feature Scaling (Standardization or Normalization)

- Train-Test Split (80-20%)

## 🤖 Model Training & Evaluation

We trained multiple models and evaluated them using:
✅ Accuracy

✅ Precision & Recall

✅ F1 Score

✅ ROC-AUC Score

✅ Confusion Matrix & ROC Curve
